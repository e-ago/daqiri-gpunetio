# Raw Ethernet Benchmarking

DAQIRI provides raw Ethernet benchmark applications that use the DPDK or ibverbs engine to drive an NVIDIA NIC directly. This page walks through `daqiri_bench_raw_gpudirect`, the TX/RX loopback config, and the raw Ethernet checks needed before interpreting throughput results.

Make sure to [build the DAQIRI library](../getting-started.md#build-the-daqiri-library) beforehand.

**Not sure which stream type to benchmark?** Start with the [Benchmarking overview](index.md). Use this page after you have chosen the raw Ethernet stream type. Use [Socket and RDMA Benchmarking](socket_benchmarking.md) for TCP, UDP, and RoCE/RDMA runs.

!!! note "Prerequisites"

    Before running the benchmarking application, ensure your system has been fully configured per the [System Configuration](../tutorials/system_configuration.md) page.

## Configure hugepages first

Size the hugepage pool to your YAML's `memory_regions` plus DPDK overhead before running. DAQIRI's preflight aborts with an actionable error (and the exact `echo N | sudo tee …` to fix it) if the pool is too small, so the simplest workflow is: run once, copy-paste the recommendation. To check current state:

```bash
grep Huge /proc/meminfo
```

For a persistent allocation across reboots, use the grub recipe in [Step 4 of System Configuration](../tutorials/system_configuration.md#step-4-enable-huge-pages).

## Running the DAQIRI container

If you built DAQIRI using the container approach, use the following command to launch the container with Raw Ethernet (DPDK) and GPU support. The host system must be fully configured (see [System Configuration](../tutorials/system_configuration.md)) before the container can access the NIC and GPU hardware.

```bash
docker run --rm -it --privileged \
  --runtime=nvidia \
  --network=host \
  -v /dev/hugepages:/dev/hugepages \
  daqiri:local bash
```

??? info "Explanation of container flags"

    | Flag | Purpose |
    |------|---------|
    | `--privileged` | DPDK requires raw access to NIC hardware, PCI devices, and hugepage files. |
    | `--runtime=nvidia` | Makes the host GPU visible inside the container via the NVIDIA Container Toolkit |
    | `--network=host` | Shares the host network namespace so DPDK can discover the physical NIC interfaces and their PCIe topology |
    | `-v /dev/hugepages:/dev/hugepages` | Mounts the hugepage filesystem for DPDK memory allocation (`--privileged` alone does not cover mounted filesystems) |

!!! warning "Hybrid iGPU + dGPU hosts (IGX Thor)"

    Select the discrete GPU by UUID in both visibility variables:

    ```bash
    nvidia-smi --query-gpu=index,name,uuid --format=csv   # on the host

    docker run --rm -it --privileged \
      --runtime=nvidia \
      --network=host \
      -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=GPU-<uuid> \
      -e CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=GPU-<uuid> \
      -v /dev/hugepages:/dev/hugepages \
      daqiri:local bash
    ```

    The selected GPU becomes CUDA ordinal **0**, so set `memory_regions[*].affinity: 0` regardless of its host-wide index.

## Update the loopback configuration

!!! tip "DGX Spark"

    Start with [`daqiri_bench_raw_tx_rx.yaml`](https://github.com/nvidia/daqiri/blob/main/examples/daqiri_bench_raw_tx_rx.yaml) to see how the TX and RX configuration fits together. On a system configured per the [DGX Spark profile](../tutorials/system_configuration.md#dgx-spark-profile), adapt the NIC addresses, use `host_pinned` memory, place the queue and application workers on the high-frequency cores, and set the destination MAC to the receiving port. [Generate a raw-Ethernet pair](../config-generation.md#generate-a-raw-ethernet-pair) can apply those system parameters and produce the concrete loopback. The `rx_port` is `0002:01:00.1` (physical port p1), so read its MAC with `cat /sys/class/net/enP2p1s0f1np1/address`.

    For multiple queues, [`daqiri_bench_raw_tx_rx_4q.yaml`](https://github.com/nvidia/daqiri/blob/main/examples/daqiri_bench_raw_tx_rx_4q.yaml) shows how queues, memory regions, flow steering, and application workers relate. [`run_spark_bench.sh`](https://github.com/nvidia/daqiri/blob/main/examples/run_spark_bench.sh) generates each single-queue benchmark cell, while [`run_spark_mq_bench.sh`](https://github.com/nvidia/daqiri/blob/main/examples/run_spark_mq_bench.sh) generates all four `(TX, RX)` multi-queue combinations.

#### Cross-host two-DGX-Spark loopback

If you have two DGX Sparks cross-cabled p0↔p0 instead of a chassis QSFP loop on one machine, generate independent TX and RX files with `raw-pair --role both`. Each host runs only its own role, so the YAML on each side configures one port instead of two. Both hosts must already be set up per the [DGX Spark profile](../tutorials/system_configuration.md#dgx-spark-profile), with one adjustment: the `daqiri-tx` (`1.1.1.1/24`) and `daqiri-rx` (`2.2.2.2/24`) nmcli profiles are *split across* the two hosts. Bring up `daqiri-tx` on the TX host's p0 and `daqiri-rx` on the RX host's p0, instead of both on one box.

**Network setup.** Assigning `/24` addresses on each host is not enough for the kernel to reach the peer over a direct cable. Install a host route on the cabled port by running [`scripts/setup_spark_xhost_net.sh`](https://github.com/nvidia/daqiri/blob/main/scripts/setup_spark_xhost_net.sh) on **both** hosts after bringing up the nmcli profile. RDMA-CM uses that route; raw ibverbs can also use it with Linux ARP when `eth_dst_addr` is omitted. The generated raw pair below supplies the RX port MAC explicitly. See the [cross-host variant](../tutorials/system_configuration.md#cross-host-variant-two-sparks) in System Configuration for the full steps.

```bash
# TX host
sudo scripts/setup_spark_xhost_net.sh --role tx

# RX host
sudo scripts/setup_spark_xhost_net.sh --role rx

# Verify on each host before starting benches
ping -c 3 <peer-ip>    # 2.2.2.2 on TX, 1.1.1.1 on RX
ip route get <peer-ip> # must name enp1s0f0np0, not lo
```

**Raw GPUDirect.** Start the RX side first so the flow rule is installed before any traffic arrives:

```bash
# RX host
sudo ./daqiri_bench_raw_gpudirect generated/raw-xhost/rx.yaml --seconds 30

# TX host; supply the RX port MAC when generating this file
sudo ./daqiri_bench_raw_gpudirect generated/raw-xhost/tx.yaml --seconds 30
```

Verify both sides report non-zero packet counts and no `NO_FREE_BURST_BUFFERS` / `NO_FREE_PACKET_BUFFERS` errors.

For a measured cabled run, capture the sender's TX PHY counters and receiver's
RX PHY counters before and after the active window. Require their packet deltas
to agree, and check DAQIRI's per-queue packet, error, missed, and no-buffer
counters for loss. Report application payload throughput separately from the
physical wire rate. For a multi-queue scaling result, retain the queue-to-core
mapping and per-queue counters so the result shows that traffic reached every
intended queue.

**RDMA.** Start the server side first:

```bash
# RX (server) host
sudo ./daqiri_bench_rdma generated/roce/rx.yaml --mode server --seconds 30

# TX (client) host
sudo ./daqiri_bench_rdma generated/roce/tx.yaml --mode client --seconds 30
```

Verify both sides report non-zero send/receive completions and no `CQ error` / `RETRY_EXC_ERR` lines in the client log.

The benchmark executables and example YAML configurations are located at:

| | Binaries | YAML configs |
|---|---|---|
| **Container** | `/opt/daqiri/bin/` | `/opt/daqiri/bin/` |
| **From source** | `./build/examples/` | `./examples/` |

The fields in the YAML configs will be explained in more detail in [Understanding the Configuration File](../tutorials/configuration-walkthrough.md). For now, we'll stick to modifying the strict minimum required fields to run the application as-is on your system.

### Hardware reorder benchmark

`daqiri_bench_raw_reorder_seq` can exercise ibverbs hardware direct placement on ConnectX-7 or
newer NICs. The `*_reorder_seq_*.yaml` hardware examples select `engine: "ibverbs"`, set
`reorder_engine: "hw"` and `cyclic_sequence: true`, and make the benchmark TX sequence wrap with
`sequence_number_modulus`. The reorder output memory region may use `kind: device` for GPUDirect
placement or a CPU-addressable kind.

The current hardware path uses the mlx5 flex parser and private receive queues; a host CPU polls
CQEs and releases complete aggregates or configured timeout passthroughs to the application. It
does not use DPA and it does not launch the software reorder kernel. Successful output includes a non-zero
`direct_placed_batches` count. Always free each received burst promptly, because its fixed output
slots are rearmed only by `free_rx_burst()`.

Before running, set `PROG_PARSE_GRAPH=1` and `FLEX_PARSER_PROFILE_ENABLE=4` persistently on the
receiving adapter and cold reboot it. See
[Enable programmable flex parsing](../tutorials/system_configuration.md#enable-programmable-flex-parsing)
for the complete `mlxconfig` procedure and verification command.

If initialization reports the following capability failure, the settings are disabled or have
not taken effect on the receiving adapter:

```text
HCA hardware-reorder caps (mlx5_0): flex(max/current)=false/false rx_ft(max/current)=true/true ... -> not supported
Hardware reorder requires FLEX_PARSE_GRAPH RX steering
```

Apply both settings with `mlxconfig` and cold reboot the adapter; changing the next-boot values
without rebooting does not alter the `current` capability reported above. If the probe still
reports `flex(max/current)=false/false` after reboot, confirm that `mlxconfig` targeted the same
adapter as the reported `mlx5_N` device and that its NIC firmware supports programmable parse
graphs.

For deterministic loss testing, set `bench_tx.sequence_drop_every` to a non-zero N, set the RX
queue's `timeout_us`, and select `missing_action: drop` or `passthrough`. With
`DAQIRI_BENCH_CHECK_REORDER_INFO=1`, the final summary reports `missing_packets` and metadata
errors. Restore `sequence_drop_every: 0` for throughput measurements.

Use `mlnx_perf -i <rx-netdev> -t 1` during a run of at least 10 seconds and report stable RX
samples after discarding startup and shutdown. For a cabled test, report the physical receive
rate. For single-port hardware loopback, report `vport_loopback_bytes` as described below and do
not add TX and RX for the same returned traffic.

### Runtime named endpoints example

The raw-ibverbs-only `daqiri_example_named_endpoints` application demonstrates
runtime Ethernet/IPv4/UDP destinations and payload-only TX buffers. Start with
[`daqiri_example_named_endpoints_tx_rx.yaml`](https://github.com/nvidia/daqiri/blob/main/examples/daqiri_example_named_endpoints_tx_rx.yaml),
replace its PCIe, CPU-core, MAC, and IP placeholders, then run:

```bash
sudo ./build/examples/daqiri_example_named_endpoints \
  ./examples/daqiri_example_named_endpoints_tx_rx.yaml --seconds 10
```

For each `bench_tx` entry, the application adds a named endpoint, verifies name
resolution to an `EndpointId`, and submits bursts on the configured queue. The
packet buffers contain only the UDP payload; DAQIRI inserts the cached header
inline in the mlx5 send WQE. The endpoint MTU and the queue's TX slot size both
bound the accepted payload. Named endpoints currently require one TX memory
region and one packet segment, so HDS configurations are rejected.

The checked-in config deliberately uses 8192 TX slots and a 256-packet batch.
Raw ibverbs may need two send work requests per TX slot, and a provider can
reject a QP request at the exact advertised `max_qp_wr`; these values leave
headroom on a device reporting `max_qp_wr: 32768`. Larger TX regions require
correspondingly greater device capacity, and both TX batch-size settings must
fit within the engine's effective TX capacity.

See [Runtime Named Endpoints](../concepts.md#runtime-named-endpoints) for the
concept and [C++ API Usage](../api-reference/cpp.md#runtime-named-endpoints-raw-ibverbs)
for lifecycle and ownership details.

### Hardware tunnel transform examples

Raw DPDK and raw ibverbs builds can program hardware flow actions that push or
encapsulate on TX and pop or decapsulate on RX. The application packet buffers
remain pre-encap on TX and post-decap on RX; DAQIRI accounts for outer-header
overhead when sizing MTU/wire frames.

Generate each variant with the same raw-pair command and one of
`--transform vlan`, `--transform vxlan`, `--transform gre`, or
`--transform nvgre`; see [configuration generation](../config-generation.md#generate-a-raw-ethernet-pair).
All four outputs run on `daqiri_bench_raw_gpudirect`.

##### Identify your NIC's PCIe addresses

Retrieve the PCIe addresses of both ports of your NIC. We'll arbitrarily use the first for Tx and the second for Rx here:

=== "ibdev2netdev"

    ```bash
    sudo ibdev2netdev -v | awk '{print $1}'
    ```

=== "lspci"

    ```bash
    # `0200` is the PCI-SIG class code for NICs
    # `15b3` is the Vendor ID for Mellanox
    lspci -n | awk '$2 == "0200:" && $3 ~ /^15b3:/ {print $1}'
    ```

??? abstract "See an example output"

    ```
    0005:03:00.0
    0005:03:00.1
    ```

##### Configure the NIC for Tx and Rx

Set the NIC addresses in the `interfaces` section of the `daqiri` configuration, making sure to remove the template brackets `< >`. This configures your NIC independently of your application:

- Set the `address` field of the `tx_port` interface to one of these addresses. That interface will be able to transmit ethernet packets.
- Set the `address` field of the `rx_port` interface to the other address. This interface will be able to receive ethernet packets.

```yaml hl_lines="3 7"
interfaces:
    - name: "tx_port"
    address: <0000:00:00.0>       # The BUS address of the interface doing Tx
    tx:
        ...
    - name: "rx_port"
    address: <0000:00:00.0>       # The BUS address of the interface doing Rx
    rx:
        ...
```

???+ abstract "See an example yaml"

    ```yaml hl_lines="3 7"
    interfaces:
        - name: "tx_port"
        address: 0005:03:00.0       # The BUS address of the interface doing Tx
        tx:
            ...
        - name: "rx_port"
        address: 0005:03:00.1       # The BUS address of the interface doing Rx
        rx:
            ...
    ```

##### Configure the application

To run the benchmarking application to run a loopback on your system, you'll need to modify the `bench_tx` section which configures the application itself, to create the packet headers, pin the application TX worker, and direct the packets to the NIC. Make sure to remove the template brackets `< >`.

- `eth_dst_addr` with the MAC address (and not the PCIe address) of the NIC interface you want to use for Rx. You can get the MAC address of your `if_name` interface with `#!bash cat /sys/class/net/$if_name/address`. Keep this field for DPDK and loopback configurations. A cross-host raw ibverbs configuration may omit it when the TX netdev has a usable IPv4 address and route; the benchmark then resolves `ip_dst_addr` through Linux routing and ARP once before its TX loop:
- `cpu_core` with the CPU core for the benchmark application's TX thread. This is separate from the DAQIRI TX queue `cpu_core`; use a different isolated core when you have one, or deliberately share when the machine has a tight core budget.

```yaml hl_lines="3 5"
bench_tx:
- interface_name: "tx_port" # Name of the TX port from the daqiri config
  cpu_core: 10              # Benchmark application TX thread affinity
  ...
  eth_dst_addr: <00:00:00:00:00:00> # Explicit MAC for DPDK or loopback
  ...
```

???+ abstract "See an example yaml"

    ```yaml hl_lines="3 5"
    bench_tx:
    - interface_name: "tx_port" # Name of the TX port from the daqiri config
      cpu_core: 10              # Benchmark application TX thread affinity
      ...
      eth_dst_addr: 48:b0:2d:ee:83:ad # Explicit MAC for DPDK or loopback
      ...
    ```

??? info "Show explanation"

    - `eth_dst_addr` - when present, this destination Ethernet MAC is embedded in packet headers without a route or neighbor lookup. When it is absent on raw ibverbs, the benchmark resolves the next-hop MAC from `ip_dst_addr` once before sending. Raw userspace TX does not otherwise invoke Linux routing or ARP because the application supplies complete Ethernet frames. If the interface also has DAQIRI RX queues, use `rx.flow_isolation: true` so ARP remains on the kernel path. A TX-only interface with no `rx.queues` needs no `rx` section.
    - The benchmark reuses the resolved MAC for the entire run; it does not monitor Linux neighbor changes. Long-running applications should define their own refresh policy and call `resolve_ipv4_mac()` again when a peer, gateway, route, link, or namespace may have changed. See [Destination MAC resolution](../concepts.md#destination-mac-resolution).
    - `cpu_core` - the benchmark application's own TX worker thread affinity. Set the matching `bench_rx.cpu_core` for RX workers too. These app-thread fields are distinct from the DAQIRI queue `cpu_core` values that poll the NIC.
    - We ignore the IP fields (`ip_src_addr`, `ip_dst_addr`) for now, as we are testing on a layer 2 network by just connecting a cable between the two interfaces on our system, therefore having mock values has no impact.
    - You might have noted the lack of an `eth_src_addr` field in this `bench_tx` section. The DPDK `tx_eth_src` egress flow rewrites the source MAC from the TX interface. For an ibverbs benchmark profile, supply the TX port MAC as `eth_src_addr` because the benchmark copies a complete packet-header template into its buffers.

## Run the loopback test

After having modified the configuration file, ensure you have connected an SFP cable between the two interfaces of your NIC, then run the application with the command below:

=== "Containerized"

    [Launch the DAQIRI container](#running-the-daqiri-container), then inside:

    ```bash
    /opt/daqiri/bin/daqiri_bench_raw_gpudirect /opt/daqiri/bin/daqiri_bench_raw_tx_rx.yaml
    ```

=== "From source"

    This assumes you have built DAQIRI and its dependencies locally on your system.

    ```bash
    sudo ./build/examples/daqiri_bench_raw_gpudirect examples/daqiri_bench_raw_tx_rx.yaml
    ```

By default the application runs for 10 seconds and then exits. You can change the duration by passing `--seconds <N>` after the YAML path, or stop it gracefully at any time with `Ctrl-C`.

### Direct-polling latency sweep

`daqiri_bench_raw_latency` measures the caller-driven raw ibverbs path with one packet
outstanding at a time. Its template, `daqiri_bench_raw_latency_ibverbs.yaml`, configures both TX
and RX with `poll_mode: direct`, enables per-packet RX hardware timestamps, and uses host-pinned
buffers by default. The benchmark also supports `huge` and `device` packet memory: packet setup and
identity checking use `cudaMemcpyDefault`, with both copies deliberately outside the reported
`send_tx_burst()` call to `get_rx_burst()` return interval. It
sweeps 64, 128, 256, ..., 8192-byte L2 frames; sizes exclude the Ethernet FCS added by the NIC.

Replace the TX/RX PCI BDFs, master/application cores, destination MAC, and RX port's
`ptp_device` in the template. The destination MAC must be the receiving port's MAC. Connect the
physical loopback path, then run:

```bash
sudo ./build/examples/daqiri_bench_raw_latency \
  examples/daqiri_bench_raw_latency_ibverbs.yaml \
  --samples 10000 --warmup 1000 --csv latency.csv \
  --realtime-priority 90
```

For a single-port internal comparison, merge the TX and RX queues under one interface, set both
`bench_latency` interface names to it, use that port's MAC and PTP device, and set
`daqiri.cfg.loopback: "hw"`. This retains the same timing boundaries while replacing the physical
cable/peer-port return with the mlx5 hardware self-loopback path.

`--realtime-priority N` locks current and future mappings with `mlockall()` and verifies that the
latency thread is running under `SCHED_FIFO` at priority `N`. It requires the corresponding
realtime scheduling and memory-lock privileges; omit it to retain normal `SCHED_OTHER` behavior.

For each packet, the measured path follows this timeline:

```text
t0  Application timestamps immediately before send_tx_burst()
t1  send_tx_burst() returns
t2  NIC records the packet's RX hardware timestamp
t3  get_rx_burst() returns the matching packet to the application
```

The summary and optional per-sample CSV combine those points into these boundaries:

| Column | Start | End | What it includes |
|--------|-------|-----|------------------|
| `tx_call_to_return_ns` | `t0` | `t1` | Direct WQE construction and SQ doorbell submission |
| `tx_call_to_rx_hw_ns` | `t0` | `t2` | TX submission, NIC transmit, physical or hardware-loopback return, and NIC receive |
| `rx_hw_to_app_ns` | `t2` | `t3` | CQ visibility, direct polling, and API return |
| `tx_call_to_app_ns` | `t0` | `t3` | Complete measured application round trip |

`tx_call_to_rx_hw_ns` is a loopback-ingress proxy, not an actual TX egress timestamp: DAQIRI does
not currently expose a TX hardware timestamp, so this value also contains the cable and NIC RX
latency. When `ptp_device` is set, the benchmark uses Linux's non-mutating extended
PHC/system cross-timestamp ioctl before and after each size and interpolates the offset for every
sample. It prints the maximum measured cross-clock uncertainty. Without `ptp_device`, the NIC PHC
must be synchronized with `CLOCK_REALTIME`; negative or implausibly large values indicate a clock
problem. Pin the application core to an isolated physical core, use the performance governor, and
save the raw CSV when investigating tails.

### Single-port hardware loopback without a cable

On mlx5 systems where the NIC remains available without a cable, DAQIRI can send packets back to
the same port internally. Start from
`daqiri_bench_raw_hw_loopback_ibverbs.yaml`, replace its PCI/core placeholders, and set
`bench_tx.eth_dst_addr` to the configured port's own MAC:

```bash
cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/net/*/address
sudo ./build/examples/daqiri_bench_raw_gpudirect \
  examples/daqiri_bench_raw_hw_loopback_ibverbs.yaml --seconds 10
```

The template exercises two TX and two RX queues: UDP port 4096 steers to RX queue 0,
and UDP port 4097 steers to RX queue 1.

This mode uses the normal receive flow rules and queue selection. Physical-network counters should
remain flat while the DAQIRI TX and RX queue counters increase. It does not help on platforms such
as DGX Spark that remove the NIC when no cable is detected.

#### Performance testing in hardware-loopback mode

Hardware-loopback throughput is not the same as throughput over a cable. Traffic stays inside the
local NIC, so the test does not include a cable, another NIC, or a second host. When the packet
buffers are in GPU memory (`kind: device`), the test also includes moving each packet from the GPU
to the NIC and back to the GPU. The result measures this complete local path. It can differ from,
or exceed, the speed of the physical network port and should not be presented as cabled network
performance.

Run the benchmark for at least 10 seconds and monitor the network interface at the same time:

```bash
sudo mlnx_perf -i <netdev> -t 1
```

For `loopback: "hw"`, report `vport_loopback_bytes`. This is the total loopback rate across all
queues. Do not add the TX and RX rates because they represent the same packets and would count the
traffic twice. Ignore the partial readings while the benchmark starts and stops; use the stable
one-second readings in the middle of the run. The `*_bytes_phy` and `*_packets_phy` counters should
remain flat, confirming that the traffic did not cross a cable. Use DAQIRI's per-queue counters to
check that packets reached the expected queues and that no packets were dropped.

When publishing results, label them **hardware-loopback throughput** and record the packet size,
queue count, buffer memory type, NIC/GPU model, and whether a post-processing workload was enabled.
Compare hardware-loopback runs only with runs using the same setup. Use a cabled TX/RX test when
the goal is physical port speed or end-to-end network performance.

`daqiri_bench_raw_gpudirect` and `daqiri_bench_raw_hds` also accept `--workload none|fft|gemm|gemm_fp16`, which runs a representative GPU workload once per received reorder window on the **actual received packet data**: `fft` (batched cuFFT C2C transform), `gemm` (FP32 `cublasSgemm`), or `gemm_fp16` (the same-size mixed-precision FP16/tensor-core matmul that models inference). Each received burst's payloads are first reordered by sequence number into a contiguous GPU buffer (`examples/bench_pipeline.{h,cu}`) that the compute then consumes. `--workload-gemm-dim N` (default 1024) pins the square GEMM side length and `--workload-fft-len N` (default 1024) the 1-D FFT transform length, so the FLOP count per call stays constant as the I/O unit is swept. The same flags are honoured by the RoCE bench (`daqiri_bench_rdma`, in-order gather) and the socket bench (`daqiri_bench_socket`, host→device stage then UDP reorder / TCP gather). See the [DGX Spark GPU-workload results](performance-dgx-spark.md#two-link-receive-throughput-with-gpu-workloads).

### GPUNetIO engine (experimental)

With a build that includes `gpunetio` in `DAQIRI_ENGINE`, `daqiri_bench_raw_tx_rx_gpunetio.yaml`
runs the same closed-loop test with CUDA kernels driving the NIC queues (DOCA GPUNetIO). Cable the
TX port to the RX port, replace the placeholders, and run it as root:

```bash
sudo ./build/examples/daqiri_bench_raw_gpudirect \
  examples/daqiri_bench_raw_tx_rx_gpunetio.yaml --seconds 10
```

Set the TX queue's `gpunetio.tx_kernel` to `persistent` (a resident kernel, several bursts in
flight) or `per_burst` (one kernel launch per burst) to compare the two TX models. Measure with
`mlnx_perf` as above. Keep `--workload none` for now: the workload modes free GPU memory with
`cudaFree()` before shutdown, which waits for the engine's resident kernels. See the
[GPUNetIO engine reference](../api-reference/configuration.md#gpunetio-engine) for the receive ring
sizing and the packet ownership rules.

## Flow programming smoke test

Raw Ethernet flow rules are programmed into the NIC during `daqiri_init()`. Software loopback
(`loopback: "sw"`) skips NIC init entirely, so it is a build/runtime smoke test only, not a
flow programming test.

| Step | Command / action | Expected |
|------|------------------|----------|
| Build smoke | `daqiri_bench_raw_sw_loopback.yaml --seconds 5` | Init succeeds, no NIC flows created |
| Cable-free NIC flow smoke | `daqiri_bench_raw_hw_loopback_ibverbs.yaml --seconds 5` (filled placeholders, NIC still enumerated) | TX and RX complete through one mlx5 port; physical-link counters remain flat |
| Good NIC config | `daqiri_bench_raw_tx_rx.yaml` (filled placeholders, cabled NIC) | Init succeeds; RX and `tx_eth_src` flows programmed |
| Dynamic RX flow config | `daqiri_example_dynamic_rx_flow.yaml` with `daqiri_example_dynamic_rx_flow` | Starts with `flow_isolation: true` and no `rx.flows`, drops unmatched traffic, tests scalar queue rules, then varies UDP source ports and verifies one `[0, 1]` RSS rule reaches both queues with the expected flow ID and tolerance |
| Dynamic resource lifecycle | Any ibverbs config with an RX queue and a single-region TX queue plus `daqiri_example_dynamic_resource` | Initializes without RX queues, creates the first RX queue, repeatedly adds and removes its steering flow, adds a TX queue, then drains and removes the queues and owned regions |
| Bad queue target | Copy `daqiri_bench_raw_tx_rx.yaml`; try `flows[0].action.id: 99`, `ids: []`, duplicate/unknown IDs, or both `id` and `ids` | Fails validation before NIC initialization |
| Static RSS flow | Change a standard IPv4/UDP flow action to `{type: queue, ids: [0, 1]}` and generate many distinct five tuples | Both queues receive packets; an unchanged tuple remains on one queue. Validate per-queue rates with `mlnx_perf` |
| Mixed flows (optional) | On one interface, add two of the three flow classes (standard UDP/IP, flex-item (see `rx.flex_items`), or eCPRI (`match.ecpri`)) in the [configuration reference](../api-reference/configuration.md) | Fails in `validate_config()` with `mixes standard (UDP/IP), flex-item and/or eCPRI` |
| eCPRI flow (optional) | On a cabled NIC, add a flow with `match: { ecpri: { msg_type: 0, pc_id: 1 } }` (see the [configuration reference](../api-reference/configuration.md)) | Init succeeds. eCPRI-over-Ethernet (EtherType 0xAEFE) frames matching the message type and pc_id steer to the flow's queue |

## Cap the transmit rate with packet pacing

To meter the transmit side at a fixed rate in hardware, set a per-queue `pacing_mbps` cap
on the TX queue. [`daqiri_bench_raw_tx_rx_pacing.yaml`](https://github.com/nvidia/daqiri/blob/main/examples/daqiri_bench_raw_tx_rx_pacing.yaml)
is the loopback config above with `pacing_mbps: 10000` (10 Gbps) on the TX queue. Pacing is
supported by both raw engines on ConnectX-7 or later. The example uses the default ibverbs
engine; add `engine: "dpdk"` beside `stream_type: "raw"` to exercise the DPDK path. The NIC
meters the queue out so its average TX rate stays at or below the configured value. The ibverbs
path uses the mlx5 packet-pacing rate table rather than per-packet WAIT WQEs; firmware defaults determine
the allowed burst size unless configured outside DAQIRI.

```bash
/opt/daqiri/bin/daqiri_bench_raw_gpudirect /opt/daqiri/bin/daqiri_bench_raw_tx_rx_pacing.yaml --seconds 10
```

Validate the cap from the `RX complete:` line: `Gbps = bytes * 8 / seconds / 1e9`. With
`pacing_mbps: 10000` the achieved rate should sit at or just below 10 Gbps regardless of
link speed. Change `pacing_mbps` (or set it to `0` to disable pacing and send at line rate)
and re-run to see the cap move.

The DPDK path requires ConnectX-7 or later native wait-on-time `SEND_ON_TIMESTAMP` support; if unavailable,
it logs a warning and runs at line rate. The ibverbs path requires ConnectX-7 or later plus
packet-pacing support for RAW_PACKET QPs and, when the driver reports a supported range, a rate
within that range. Older drivers that omit the range defer the check to the provider when applying
the rate; unsupported requests still fail initialization instead of silently ignoring the cap.

## Tune RDMA SEND completion signaling

The RDMA engine signals every SEND work request by default. For `daqiri_bench_rdma`
runs where CQ polling overhead is part of the bottleneck investigation, set
`DAQIRI_RDMA_SEND_SIGNAL_EVERY=N` to request one signaled SEND every `N` posts:

```bash
DAQIRI_RDMA_SEND_SIGNAL_EVERY=16 \
  /opt/daqiri/bin/daqiri_bench_rdma /opt/daqiri/bin/daqiri_bench_rdma_tx_rx.yaml
```

Larger values reduce SEND completion traffic, but completions also drive
application credits and buffer recycling in the benchmark. Keep the variable
unset, or set it to `1`, for baseline measurements.

## Watch live OpenTelemetry metrics in Grafana

DAQIRI can expose the raw benchmark counters through OpenTelemetry when metrics
support is enabled at build time. The Grafana example uses the same benchmark
binary and YAML files as the loopback test above, then starts Prometheus and
Grafana beside the benchmark process.

Build the container with metrics enabled:

```bash
DAQIRI_ENABLE_OTEL_METRICS=ON DAQIRI_ENGINE="dpdk ibverbs" scripts/build-container.sh
```

Before starting the stack, fill in the required `<placeholders>` in the benchmark
YAML you plan to run. You can also pass a machine-local copy through
`DAQIRI_CONFIG` so the tracked example YAML keeps its placeholder syntax.

```bash
cd examples/grafana
DAQIRI_CONFIG=/workspace/daqiri/examples/daqiri_bench_raw_tx_rx.yaml \
DAQIRI_SECONDS=60 \
docker compose up
```

Prometheus scrapes `http://localhost:9464/metrics`, and Grafana serves the
`DAQIRI OpenTelemetry Metrics` dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`. The
throughput panel reports payload counter rates in `Gb/s` for each active
interface and queue.

To inspect the speed the data is moving through the NIC, run `mlnx_perf` on one of the interfaces in a separate terminal, concurrently with the application running:

```bash
sudo mlnx_perf -i $if_name
```

The `*_packets_phy` and `*_bytes_phy` counters measure traffic that crosses a physical network cable. Some same-machine tests keep traffic inside the NIC, so the internal counters may rise while the physical counters stay flat. For single-port hardware loopback, follow the [hardware-loopback performance methodology](#performance-testing-in-hardware-loopback-mode) and use `vport_loopback_bytes` instead.

!!! warning "Check flow control before trusting a throughput number"

    If the measured rate plateaus well below line rate with **zero** drops, suspect 802.3x pause before you suspect the transmitter. A paused link idles instead of dropping, so nothing in the counter set above distinguishes it from a sender that cannot go faster.

    DAQIRI reports this itself. Pause is not exposed through DPDK's xstats, so the raw engines read it from the kernel netdev: a warning at init when pause is enabled on a port, and the `rx_pause_ctrl_phy` / `tx_pause_ctrl_phy` frames exchanged **during that run** alongside the shutdown stats dump.

    ```log
    [WARN] Flow control: port 0 (ens15f0np0) has 802.3x pause enabled (rx on, tx on). A paused
    link idles instead of dropping, so this can prevent achieving higher rates ...
          rx_pause_ctrl_phy:            34293
          tx_pause_ctrl_phy:            0
    [WARN] Flow control: port 0 (ens15f0np0) exchanged 34293 pause frames during this run
    (received 34293, sent 0), so the link spent time paused ... The link partner asserted
    pause, throttling this port's transmit. ...
    ```

    `rx_pause_ctrl_phy` counts frames **received**, so it is the peer throttling this port's transmit. `tx_pause_ctrl_phy` counts frames **sent**, so it points at this host's receive path. Because these are per-run deltas, a non-zero value means flow control throttled *this* measurement.

    Pause frames are not automatically a misconfiguration: shallow-buffer peers can use them as intended backpressure. Establish which end is asserting pause, and whether the peer can absorb line rate at all, before disabling it. To check a host before running anything, use `sudo ./python/tune_system.py --check pause`; see [Step 10 of System Configuration](../tutorials/system_configuration.md#step-10-disable-ethernet-flow-control-pause) for disablement guidance.

??? tip "Troubleshooting"

    ??? failure "Cannot create HWS action since HWS is not supported"

        Example error:

        ```log
        mlx5_net: [mlx5dr_action_create_generic_bulk]: Cannot create HWS action since HWS is not supported
        mlx5_net: Failed to start port 0 0005:03:00.0: fail to configure port
        [CRITICAL] Cannot start device err=-95, port=0
        ```

        Raw Ethernet (DPDK-backed) uses Hardware Steering (HWS) via the `dv_flow_en=2` mlx5 device argument. HWS requires compatible versions of both the NIC firmware and the host's MLNX_OFED kernel modules. Per the [DPDK mlx5 documentation](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/nics/mlx5.html), the minimum requirements are ConnectX-6 Dx or later with firmware `xx.35.1012`+, but the host's OFED/kernel driver must also support the HWS features expected by the DPDK version in use.

        Check your OFED and firmware versions:

        ```bash
        cat /sys/module/mlx5_core/version   # Host OFED kernel module version
        ethtool -i <interface_name> | grep firmware  # NIC firmware version
        ```

        To resolve, update your NIC firmware and OFED drivers, or contact the DAQIRI team for guidance on compatible version combinations.

    ??? failure "EAL: failed to parse device"

        Make sure to set valid PCIe addresses in the `address` fields in `interfaces`, per [instructions above](#configure-the-nic-for-tx-and-rx).

    ??? failure "Invalid MAC address format"

        Make sure to set a valid MAC address in the `eth_dst_addr` field in `bench_tx`, per [instructions above](#configure-the-application).

    ??? failure "mlx5_common: Fail to create MR for address [...] Could not DMA map EXT memory"

        Example error:

        ```log
        mlx5_common: Fail to create MR for address (0xffff2fc00000)
        mlx5_common: Device 0005:03:00.0 unable to DMA map

        [critical] [adv_network_dpdk_mgr.cpp:430] Failed to map MRs
        ```

        Check the [GPUDirect setup](../tutorials/system_configuration.md#enable-gpudirect) for your
        deployment. Some host builds use `nvidia-peermem`; the container path uses
        dma-buf support from the patched DPDK build.

    ??? failure "EAL: Couldn't get fd on hugepage file [..] error allocating rte services array"

        Example error:

        ```log
        EAL: get_seg_fd(): open '/mnt/huge/nwlrbbmqbhmap_0' failed: Permission denied
        EAL: Couldn't get fd on hugepage file

        EAL: FATAL: rte_service_init() failed
        EAL: rte_service_init() failed
        ```

        Ensure you run as root, using `sudo`.

    ??? failure "EAL: Cannot get hugepage information."

        ```log
        EAL: x hugepages of size x reserved, no mounted hugetlbfs found for that size
        ```

        Ensure your [hugepages are mounted](../tutorials/system_configuration.md#step-4-enable-huge-pages).

        ```log
        EAL: No free x kB hugepages reported on node 0
        ```

        Reachable only when the in-process preflight is bypassed (e.g. running an older binary against a host with hugepages reserved but not mounted). Mount per [System Configuration: Step 4](../tutorials/system_configuration.md#step-4-enable-huge-pages) and re-run.

    ??? failure "Stale `<file-prefix>map_*` files in /dev/hugepages after a SIGKILL"

        Init- and shutdown-path cleanup is automatic. Files only leak if the process is `SIGKILL`ed (OOM, container hard-stop). Symptom: `HugePages_Free: 0` with no bench running.

        ```bash
        pgrep -af daqiri_bench   # confirm nothing is running
        sudo rm -f /dev/hugepages/*map_* /mnt/huge/*map_*
        ```

    ??? failure "Could not allocate x MB of GPU memory [...] Failed to allocate GPU memory"

        Check your GPU utilization:

        ```bash
        nvidia-smi pmon -c 1
        ```

        You might need to kill some of the listed processes to free up GPU VRAM.
