# Configuration YAML Reference

DAQIRI is configured through a YAML file or a `NetworkConfig` struct built in code.
Either form defines memory regions, NIC interfaces, TX/RX queues, and flow rules, and
is passed to `daqiri_init()` at startup. The struct form is useful for customers who
want to interoperate with existing configuration code.

Start with the commented configurations under `examples/` to see complete,
readable configurations and understand how the fields fit together. When you
need repeatable production, benchmark, multi-queue, or cross-host variants, use
[Configuration Generation](../config-generation.md) to apply system and topology
parameters consistently.

## Optional validation without hardware initialization

Use `daqiri_config_validate` to check YAML files before running an application, such as in CI or
on a machine without the target NIC. `daqiri_init()` performs these checks during startup. The
command cannot determine whether the selected engine and hardware support every requested
setting.

```bash
daqiri_config_validate config.yaml another-config.yaml
```

The command exits with status `0` when every file is valid, `1` when any file is invalid, and
`2` when no file was provided. Use `daqiri_config_validate --list-engines` to print the
engines compiled into the validator and exit successfully without checking files.
It is built and installed even when `DAQIRI_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF`.

OpenTelemetry metrics do not add YAML fields. Metrics-enabled builds use the
same interface, queue, and flow names from the active configuration as metric
labels, and applications are still responsible for configuring the OpenTelemetry
SDK/exporter before running DAQIRI.

## Common Configuration

These settings apply globally to both TX and RX:

- **`version`**: Config version. Only `1` is valid currently.
  - type: `integer`
- **`master_core`**: CPU core used to fork and join network threads. This core is not used
  for packet processing and can be bound to a non-isolated core. Should differ from isolated
  cores assigned to queues.
  - type: `integer`
- **`stream_type`**: Packet I/O stream class.
  - type: `string`
  - values: `raw`, `socket`
- **`engine`**: Optional implementation engine for the selected stream type. Omit this
  unless you need a specific implementation override. For `stream_type: "raw"` the
  default is `ibverbs`, which uses the Multi-Packet (striding) Receive Queue engine on
  Mellanox/mlx5 NICs; set `engine: "dpdk"` to use DPDK instead. RoCE configs infer `ibverbs` from
  `roce://` endpoint URIs by default. `engine: "gpunetio"` selects the experimental DOCA GPUNetIO
  raw engine, which is never a default; see [GPUNetIO engine](#gpunetio-engine).
  - type: `string`
  - values: `dpdk`, `socket`, `ibverbs`, `gpunetio`
- **`log_level`**: Engine log level.
  - type: `string`
  - values: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn` (default), `error`, `critical`, `off`
  - any other value is rejected during configuration parsing
- **`loopback`**: Select a loopback mode for local testing.
  - type: `string`
  - values: `""` (disabled, default), `"sw"` (DPDK software loopback, no NIC),
    `"hw"` (single-port mlx5 hardware loopback, raw `ibverbs` engine only)
  - hardware loopback requires one physical interface containing both TX and RX queues;
    transmitted unicast packets must use that port's own destination MAC
- **`tx_meta_buffers`**: Metadata buffers for transmit. One buffer is used for each burst
  of packets.
  - type: `integer`
  - default: `256`
- **`rx_meta_buffers`**: Metadata buffers for receive. One buffer is used for each burst
  of packets.
  - type: `integer`
  - default: `256`

## Memory Regions

`memory_regions:` List of regions where packet buffers are stored. The number of regions
and their `kind` determines the receive mode (CPU-only, header-data split, or batched GPU).

YAML describes region semantics but never contains process-local pointers. C++ and Python callers
can attach application-owned allocations by name at initialization; see
[Application-owned memory regions](cpp.md#application-owned-memory-regions). A runtime binding
replaces DAQIRI's allocation for that region. The legacy `owned: false` form requires a matching
runtime binding.

- **`name`**: Memory region name. Referenced by queue configurations.
  - type: `string`
- **`kind`**: Memory type.
  - type: `string`
  - values:
    - `huge`: Explicit hugetlb CPU memory (recommended for CPU buffers). Initialization fails
      if the configured hugetlb pool cannot satisfy it; DAQIRI never silently substitutes
      regular pages or transparent hugepages.
    - `device`: GPU memory (requires GPUDirect via peermem or DMA-BUF). On a system such as
      IGX Thor with both an integrated and a discrete GPU, set `affinity` to the discrete GPU's
      process-local CUDA ordinal.
    - `host_pinned`: Pinned CPU pages allocated via `cudaHostAlloc`. **Recommended on
      integrated GPUs (e.g. NVIDIA GB10 / DGX Spark)**, where the NIC cannot peer-DMA
      into device memory and CUDA reports DMA-BUF unsupported. Use this kind when remaining on
      the integrated GPU in a hybrid-GPU system such as IGX Thor. On discrete-GPU systems,
      prefer `device` for high-throughput RX/TX paths.
    - `host`: Regular CPU memory (not recommended)
  With the raw ibverbs engine, DAQIRI-owned `huge` regions declared in the startup configuration
  and having the same NUMA affinity share a hugetlb arena. DAQIRI chooses the available page size
  that can back the regions with the least rounding, while registering every region separately.
  For example, twenty-two 32 MiB regions require one 1 GiB page—not twenty-two—when the host has
  only 1 GiB hugepages.

- **`affinity`**: Process-local CUDA ordinal for `device` and `host_pinned` memory, or NUMA
  node ID for `huge` and `host` memory. CUDA ordinals reflect only the devices visible to the
  process and need not match host-wide GPU indices.

  On a mixed integrated/discrete GPU host, select the intended discrete GPU by its stable UUID
  when starting a privileged NVIDIA container. For example, after identifying the UUID with
  `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=uuid,name --format=csv,noheader`, pass it to both visibility variables:

  ```bash
  docker run --privileged --runtime=nvidia \
    -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<discrete-GPU-UUID> \
    -e CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<discrete-GPU-UUID> ...
  ```

  When that is the only CUDA-visible GPU, it has process-local ordinal `0`, even if it has a
  different host-wide index. Configure `affinity` using the process-local ordinal, not the host
  index. On the tested IGX Thor privileged-container setup, UUID-based selection prevents the
  integrated GPU from remaining selected.
  - type: `integer`
- **`access`**: Memory access permissions.
  - type: `list`
  - values: `local`, `rdma_read`, `rdma_write`
- **`num_bufs`**: Number of buffers in this region. Higher values give more processing
  headroom but consume more memory (GPU BAR1 for `device`). Too low risks dropped packets
  on RX or a TX stall. For socket TCP RX queues, the smallest `num_bufs` among the queue's
  memory regions bounds the number of bursts DAQIRI holds internally. When that queue fills,
  DAQIRI stops calling `recv()`, allowing TCP flow control to backpressure the sender. UDP RX
  does not wait for this internal queue capacity. See
  [TCP receive backpressure and queue sizing](../benchmarks/socket_benchmarking.md#tcp-receive-backpressure-and-queue-sizing)
  for sizing guidance and ownership details. Raw DPDK queue regions use a floor of
  `max(1.5 * ring, ring + 2 * batch_size)`. DAQIRI bumps values below that floor to
  `max(3 * ring, ring + 4 * batch_size)` and warns with the exact `num_bufs` to configure.
  With the default 8192-descriptor ring and `batch_size: 10240`, the floor is 28672 and the
  bump target is 49152; the shipped `num_bufs: 51200` is sufficient.

  Raw ibverbs uses a separate hardware limit. A scheduled packet can consume two send work
  requests, so usable TX slots are capped at `max_qp_wr / 2`. DAQIRI warns when configured
  storage exceeds that cap and fails initialization with the exact maximum when `batch_size`
  exceeds it. Providers can also reject a QP request at the exact advertised maximum, so
  portable configs should leave headroom. The named-endpoint example uses 8192 TX slots and
  a 256-packet batch, requiring at most 16384 send work requests rather than the 32768
  reported by the demonstrated ConnectX-7 device.
  - type: `integer`
- **`buf_size`**: Size of each buffer in bytes. Should match the expected packet size, or
  the segment size when using header-data split.
  - type: `integer`

### Example: Header-Data Split

Two regions, a small CPU region for headers and a GPU region for payload:

```yaml
memory_regions:
- name: "RX_CPU"
  kind: "huge"
  affinity: 0
  access:
    - local
  num_bufs: 51200
  buf_size: 64        # ETH+IP+UDP headers (~42 bytes, padded)
- name: "RX_GPU"
  kind: "device"
  affinity: 0
  access:
    - local
  num_bufs: 51200
  buf_size: 1000      # payload
```

## Interfaces

`interfaces:` List of NIC interfaces to configure.

- **`name`**: Interface name. Used to look up port IDs at runtime via `get_port_id()`.
  - type: `string`
- **`address`**: PCIe BDF address (from `lspci`) or Linux interface name for Raw Ethernet
  (`stream_type: "raw"`), or IP address for RoCE (`stream_type: "socket"` with a
  `roce://` endpoint).
  - type: `string`

### Socket and RDMA Endpoint Configuration

Socket-style streams use a `socket_config` block for endpoint role and addressing.
Endpoint addresses are URI strings. Supported schemes are `tcp://`, `udp://`, and
`roce://` (`rdma://` is still accepted as a legacy alias).

- **`socket_config.mode`**: Connection role.
  - type: `string`
  - values: `client`, `server`
- **`socket_config.local_addr`**: Local bind endpoint, for example
  `tcp://127.0.0.1:6001`, `roce://10.100.3.1:4096`, or
  `roce://10.100.1.1` for a RoCE client whose source port is chosen by RDMA CM.
  Required for server mode and RoCE client mode.
- **`socket_config.remote_addr`**: Remote peer endpoint, for example
  `udp://10.250.0.2:5021`. Required for TCP/UDP client mode. RoCE clients choose
  the peer in application code (for example by calling `rdma_connect_to_server`),
  not in DAQIRI config. It is optional for UDP server mode; when present, DAQIRI
  connects the socket to that expected peer so other sources are rejected by the
  kernel and multi-datagram receive batching is safe.
- **`socket_config.local_ip`** / **`socket_config.local_port`** and
  **`socket_config.remote_ip`** / **`socket_config.remote_port`**: Legacy endpoint
  fields accepted for older configs when a top-level engine override provides the
  transport.

Linux TCP/UDP socket options are intentionally not configured in YAML. Apply them
after connection setup with `socket_setsockopt(conn_id, level, optname, optval,
optlen)`, using the numeric constants from the target system headers. The API is
not supported for `roce://` endpoints.

For compatibility, a UDP server without `remote_addr` operates in a
single-active-peer mode: each received datagram replaces the endpoint's current
reply target. This does not preserve request/reply association when multiple
clients interleave traffic. DAQIRI limits such endpoints to one datagram per
receive burst. Configure `remote_addr` for point-to-point operation, peer
filtering, and receive batching.

When using RoCE, set `stream_type: "socket"` and use `roce://` endpoint addresses
plus a `roce_config` block for transport settings. A RoCE URI may include
`?engine=ibverbs`; when omitted, `ibverbs` is the default and only supported RoCE
engine.

- **`roce_config.transport_mode`**: RDMA transport type.
  - type: `string`
  - values: `RC` (Reliable Connected), `UC` (Unreliable Connected)

Each RoCE client connection uses one TX queue from the interface whose `address`
field matches the connection's local IP address. An application can choose that
local IP by passing a source address to `rdma_connect_to_server`. If it does not,
Linux chooses the local IP and network interface it would normally use to reach the
server.
Queue positions are independent for each interface: the first connection through
an interface uses position 0, and later connections through the same interface use
the lowest unused position. A connection fails with `NO_SPACE_AVAILABLE` when all
TX queues on that interface are already in use.

## Receive Configuration (rx)

### Queues

`rx.queues:` List of receive queues on the interface.

- **`name`**: Queue name.
  - type: `string`
- **`id`**: Integer ID used for flow steering and burst retrieval.
  - type: `integer`
- **`poll_mode`**: `indirect` uses the current DAQIRI RX worker and application handoff ring.
  `direct` makes the thread calling `get_rx_burst()` poll the NIC synchronously and is supported
  only by the raw ibverbs engine.
  - type: `string`
  - values: `indirect`, `direct`
  - default: `indirect`
- **`cpu_core`**: CPU core ID for the RX worker thread. Required in indirect mode and forbidden
  in direct mode. For `udp://` socket endpoints, this pins the thread that calls `recvmmsg()`;
  application threads use their own affinity settings. Should be an isolated core for best
  performance. Use `-1` to leave a socket UDP receive thread unpinned.
  - type: `string`
- **`batch_size`**: Maximum number of packets per batch passed to the application. Larger values
  increase throughput, and smaller values reduce latency. For `udp://` socket endpoints, one
  `recvmmsg()` call returns up to this many datagrams; valid values are 1-32. UDP servers without
  a configured `remote_addr` are limited to one datagram per burst. Required in indirect mode and
  forbidden in direct mode. A direct poll returns the packets currently ready, up to 256, without
  waiting.
  - type: `integer`
  - C++ or Python callers constructing an indirect UDP RX queue programmatically must set this
    field explicitly. The default `CommonQueueConfig` value of `0` is not a valid UDP batch size.
- **`memory_regions`**: List of memory region names (defined in [Memory Regions](#memory-regions)).
  The order determines segment mapping: first region = segment 0, second = segment 1, etc.
  A single region means all packet data lands in one place, while two regions enables header-data
  split.
  - type: `list`
- **`timeout_us`**: Timeout in microseconds. A partial batch is delivered if this time elapses
  before `batch_size` packets are collected. Set to `0` to disable (wait for full batch only).
  Forbidden in direct mode.
  - type: `integer`
  - default: `0`

Direct queues must be polled by exactly one user thread per queue. They do not create an RX
worker or handoff ring, so an application stall also stops packet reception and buffer recycling.
A direct queue cannot be targeted by an RX reorder configuration. Unsupported engines, reorder,
or forbidden worker fields produce a warning followed by configuration failure.

For the raw ibverbs engine, the same `RxQueueConfig` represented by this YAML block can be passed
to `add_rx_queue_async()` after initialization. Its memory regions must already exist, and its
batch capacity cannot exceed the metadata capacity fixed at initialization: at least 256 packets,
or the largest startup queue batch when that is greater. Runtime queues are not written back to
the YAML file. Install a dynamic RX flow after queue creation to route traffic to it; delete that
flow before requesting queue removal.

### Flex Items

`rx.flex_items:` Flexible parser items for custom flow matching beyond standard UDP fields.

- **`name`**: Name of the flex item.
  - type: `string`
- **`id`**: ID of the flex item. Scoped per interface. The same numeric ID on two
  interfaces may refer to different parser settings.
  - type: `integer`
- **`offset`**: Byte offset after the UDP header where matching begins. Must be a multiple
  of 4 and less than 28.
  - type: `integer`
- **`udp_dst_port`**: UDP destination port for flex item activation.
  - type: `integer`

### Flows

`rx.flows:` Static startup flow rules that steer packets to specific queues based on
match criteria. This sequence may be omitted, and a queues-only RX config can add DPDK RX
flows later with the dynamic flow API. For Raw Ethernet on the DPDK and ibverbs engines,
RX flows can also perform hardware VLAN pop or tunnel decapsulation before queue delivery.

- **`name`**: Flow name.
  - type: `string`
- **`id`**: Flow ID. Retrievable at runtime via `get_packet_flow_id()`.
  - type: `integer`
- **`action`**: Legacy single action map. Existing configs may keep using
  `action: {type: queue, id: ...}`. A multi-queue destination uses
  `action: {type: queue, ids: [0, 1]}`.
- **`actions`**: Ordered action list. Use this for tunnel/VLAN transforms.
  RX transform flows must end with `type: queue`.
  - **`type: queue`**: Steer matched packets to an RX queue.
    - **`id`**: Queue ID under `rx.queues` on the same interface.
    - **`ids`**: Non-empty list of unique queue IDs under `rx.queues` on the same
      interface. One entry is direct steering. Two or more entries automatically
      enable RSS. IP/UDP matches use flow-affine Toeplitz hashing over source and
      destination IPv4 addresses and UDP ports. An Ethernet-only match remains
      MAC-only; it does not implicitly add IPv4/UDP criteria, so matching non-IP
      frames remain eligible for the RSS destination. `id` and `ids` are mutually
      exclusive.
  - **`type: vlan_pop`**: Pop one VLAN tag in hardware.
  - **`type: tunnel_decap`**: Decapsulate a hardware tunnel before queue delivery.
    - **`tunnel.type`**: `vxlan`, `gre`, or `nvgre`.
    - **`outer_eth_src` / `outer_eth_dst`**: Outer Ethernet addresses.
    - **`outer_ipv4_src` / `outer_ipv4_dst`**: Outer IPv4 addresses. IPv6 outer
      headers are not supported in v1.
    - **VXLAN fields**: `vni`, optional `outer_udp_src`, `outer_udp_dst` default `4789`.
    - **GRE fields**: optional `gre_protocol` default `0x0800`.
    - **NVGRE fields**: `tni`, optional `flow_id`.
- **`match`**: Criteria for matching packets.
  - **`udp_src`**: UDP source port or port range (e.g., `1000-1010`).
    - type: `integer` or `string`
  - **`udp_dst`**: UDP destination port or port range.
    - type: `integer` or `string`
  - **`ipv4_len`**: IPv4 payload length.
    - type: `integer`
  - **`flex_item_id`**: Flex item ID (the `id` field from an entry under `rx.flex_items` on
    the same interface). Cannot be combined with UDP/IP matching.
    - type: `integer`
  - **`val`**: 32-bit value to match (with flex items).
    - type: `integer`
  - **`mask`**: 32-bit mask applied before matching (with flex items).
    - type: `integer`
  - **`ecpri`**: eCPRI-over-Ethernet match (EtherType `0xAEFE`). Presence of this map selects
    the eCPRI flow class. The EtherType is matched implicitly. Cannot be combined with UDP/IP
    or flex-item matching. A flow with an empty `ecpri: {}` map matches all eCPRI frames.
    - **`msg_type`**: eCPRI common-header message type (e.g. `0` = IQ data, `2` = real-time
      control). Optional.
      - type: `integer`
    - **`pc_id`** / **`rtc_id`**: eCPRI message identifier (the 16-bit physical-channel ID for
      message types 0/1, or real-time-control ID for type 2). `pc_id` and `rtc_id` are aliases
      for the same field. Optional, but matching it requires a `msg_type` (the NIC needs a known
      message type to locate the identifier in the eCPRI header).
      - type: `integer`

  - **`ethernet`**: Raw Ethernet address match. The map must contain at least one address.
    It can be used alone or combined with IPv4/UDP, flex-item, or eCPRI criteria; all
    configured criteria must match for the rule to apply.
    - **`src`**: Source MAC address to match. Optional.
      - type: `string`
      - format: `xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx`
    - **`dst`**: Destination MAC address to match. Optional.
      - type: `string`
      - format: `xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx`


For Raw Ethernet (`stream_type: "raw"`), each flow rule is programmed into the NIC during
`daqiri_init()`. If any rule cannot be installed, or the send-to-kernel fallback cannot be
created when `flow_isolation: true`, initialization fails with a critical log and
`daqiri_init()` returns an error status. eCPRI matching is supported by both the `dpdk`
(via the mlx5 eCPRI flow item) and `ibverbs` (via an mlx5 flex-parser node anchored on the
eCPRI EtherType) engines. On the `dpdk` engine the mlx5 eCPRI flow item is only honored under
firmware steering, so any interface with eCPRI flows is automatically switched to
`dv_flow_en=1` (logged as a warning); a side effect is that the async/template dynamic-RX-flow
API is unavailable on that interface. The `ibverbs` engine has no such restriction.

A single RX interface must use exactly one protocol flow class: standard UDP/IP (including
Ethernet-only rules), flex-item, or eCPRI. Ethernet address criteria may qualify a rule in
any of these classes and do not select a separate class when protocol criteria are present.
Each class installs its own DPDK group-0 jump rule, and these conflict when mixed, so only one
class is reachable per interface. `daqiri_init` rejects mixed configs with a clear error.
Flex-item flows cannot be combined with VLAN/tunnel transform actions in v1.

Multi-queue RSS is supported for standard IPv4/UDP and flex-item flows. A flex
item selects the rule, but its sampled value is not an RSS input; distribution
still uses the packet's IPv4/UDP tuple. VLAN-pop rules hash the IPv4/UDP packet
after the VLAN header, and tunnel-decap rules hash the inner IPv4/UDP tuple.
eCPRI flows cannot use multi-queue RSS because they have no applicable UDP/IP
five tuple. Queue-list order affects hash-to-queue mapping, but does not express
weights.

RSS is flow-affine: every packet with an unchanged five tuple stays on one
queue. Roughly even packet counts require enough distinct tuples with reasonably
balanced traffic; this is not packet striping or exact round-robin delivery.
There is no queue-action mode field in configuration version 1; a future stripe mode can be
added without changing the multi-ID RSS default. If
the NIC rejects an RSS action, static initialization or the dynamic flow
completion fails rather than falling back to one queue.

### Flow Isolation

`rx.flow_isolation:` When `true`, only packets matching an explicit flow rule are delivered
to the application. Static startup flows install send-to-kernel fallback rules per flow class
(standard, flex-item, or eCPRI), so unmatched traffic in those classes is steered back to the Linux
kernel. Queues-only configs can set `flow_isolation: true` and then install dynamic RX flows
after `daqiri_init()`; the first dynamic RX flow installs the send-to-kernel fallback for that
flow class (so unmatched control traffic such as ARP keeps reaching the kernel), and until a
dynamic rule is added, application traffic is not delivered to DAQIRI RX queues. When `false`,
unmatched packets go to a default queue. Mixing standard, flex-item, and eCPRI flow classes on
one interface is not supported, including across dynamic flow additions or within one dynamic
batch.

- type: `boolean`
- default: `false`

### Dynamic Flow Capacity

`rx.dynamic_flow_capacity:` DPDK template-table capacity reserved for dynamic RX flow
rules on this interface. `0` disables DPDK template/async setup on startup. Set a positive
value to opt in to the template fast path when it is available and the NIC has enough async
flow resources. Legacy fallback paths still accept dynamic RX flow operations but do not use
a template table.

- type: `integer`
- default: `0`

### Hardware Timestamps

`rx.hardware_timestamps:` Enable per-packet hardware RX timestamps.
When enabled, DAQIRI requires hardware timestamp support from the NIC and driver.
Timestamps returned by `get_packet_rx_timestamp()` are unsigned 64-bit PTP epoch
nanoseconds in the same clock domain as a PTP-synchronized `CLOCK_REALTIME`.
The raw ibverbs engine requests the mlx5 real-time CQ timestamp format only when
the device advertises it; otherwise it uses the default mlx5 device-clock CQ
format and converts those ticks to nanoseconds internally. Device-clock ticks are
not exposed by the public API.
**WARNING: PTP synchronization is required.** DAQIRI does not validate the NIC or system clock
configuration. Timestamp values are invalid if the clocks are not PTP-synchronized.

- type: `boolean`
- default: `false`

### RX Reorder Configs

`rx.reorder_configs:` Optional automatic packet reordering/aggregation plans. Implemented
for Raw Ethernet (`stream_type: "raw"`) only in v1. GPU reorder requires CUDA-addressable
packet buffers (`device` or `host_pinned` memory regions). CPU reorder requires CPU-addressable
packet buffers (`host`, `host_pinned`, or `huge` memory regions).

v1 source-memory requirement:
- Reorder queues must use exactly one RX source memory region.
- Header-data split RX queues are not supported with `rx.reorder_configs`.

v1 batch-size requirement:
- For each emitted reordered batch, packets are expected to have identical on-wire length.
- `payload_byte_offset` is applied uniformly to all packets in the batch, so mixed packet sizes
  in the same reorder batch are not supported.
- Timeout-flushed reordered bursts set `DAQIRI_BURST_FLAG_REORDER_TIMEOUT` in
  `burst->hdr.hdr.burst_flags`. All reordered bursts set `DAQIRI_BURST_FLAG_REORDERED`.
  `burst->hdr.hdr.max_pkt` contains the number of source packets represented by the aggregate.
- Reordered bursts expose `ReorderBurstInfo::batch_id` via
  `daqiri::get_reorder_burst_info(...)`. With `seq_batch_number`, the batch ID is copied from
  the configured batch-number field. With `seq_packets_per_batch`, the batch ID is derived from
  `sequence_number / packets_per_batch`.

- **`name`**: Reorder config name. Must be unique per interface.
  - type: `string`
- **`reorder_engine`**: Reorder implementation. `sw` preserves the CUDA/CPU copy path;
  `hw` selects ibverbs first-DMA placement on supported mlx5 NICs.
  Hardware mode requires the adapter settings `PROG_PARSE_GRAPH=1` and
  `FLEX_PARSER_PROFILE_ENABLE=4`; follow the
  [mlxconfig setup procedure](../tutorials/system_configuration.md#enable-programmable-flex-parsing) and cold
  reboot the adapter after changing them.
  - type: `string`
  - values: `sw`, `hw`
  - default: `sw`
- **`cyclic_sequence`**: Required acknowledgement for `reorder_engine: hw`. Hardware placement
  uses exact 32-bit programmable-parser samples, so the sampled destination value must cycle over
  the finite output ring and all non-address bits in each sampled word must remain zero. Wide
  monotonic sequence values are unsupported; use `reorder_engine: sw` for those streams.
  - type: `boolean`
  - default: `false`
- **`missing_action`**: Action when the owning RX queue's `timeout_us` elapses before every
  sequence slot arrives. `drop` frees the partial batch without delivering it. `passthrough`
  delivers the fixed-size aggregate with `DAQIRI_BURST_FLAG_REORDER_TIMEOUT`; received slots are
  valid and missing slots are unspecified, so consult `get_reorder_missing_info()` first.
  - type: `string`
  - values: `drop`, `passthrough`
  - default: `passthrough`
- **`reorder_type`**: Reorder implementation (`gpu` or `cpu`).
  - type: `string`
  - values: `gpu`, `cpu`
- **`memory_region`**: Output memory region where reordered payload is written.
  - type: `string`
  - requirements: for `gpu`, must reference a `device` or `host_pinned` memory region. For
    `cpu`, must reference a `host`, `host_pinned`, or `huge` memory region
- **`payload_byte_offset`**: Byte offset in each packet where copied payload starts. Bytes before
  this offset are skipped.
  - type: `integer`
- **`packet_size`**: Payload bytes placed in each output slot by `reorder_engine: hw`, excluding
  the bytes skipped by `payload_byte_offset`. Required for hardware reorder and ignored by the
  software path.
  - type: `integer`
  - performance note: values below 4000 bytes are accepted but emit a warning because the current
    ibverbs direct-placement implementation performs much better with larger packets
- **`data_types`**: Optional payload data type conversion for GPU reorder. If omitted, payload
  bytes are copied as-is.
  - `input_type`: On-wire input element type. Values: `int4`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`
  - `output_type`: Reordered output element type. Values: `fp16`, `bf16`, `fp32`, `fp64`, `int32`
  - `endianness`: Optional input byte order. Values: `host`, `network`; default: `host`
  - requirements: conversion is supported for `reorder_type: "gpu"`; the output memory region
    buffer must hold the converted batch size
  - notes: `int4` is interpreted as two signed 4-bit two's-complement values per byte, high
    nibble first; `network` endianness swaps byte-multiple input types wider than 8 bits
- **`flow_ids`**: List of RX flow IDs this reorder config applies to.
  - type: `list[integer]`
  - notes: flow IDs cannot overlap across reorder configs on the same interface;
    a referenced flow must use direct steering to one queue, not multi-queue RSS
- **`method`**: Exactly one method must be configured:
  - **`seq_batch_number`**
    - `sequence_number.bit_offset`
    - `sequence_number.bit_width` (1..32)
    - `batch_number.bit_offset`
    - `batch_number.bit_width` (1..32)
    - Derived constraint: `2^seq_bits` must be divisible by `2^batch_bits`
  - **`seq_packets_per_batch`**
    - `sequence_number.bit_offset`
    - `sequence_number.bit_width` (1..32)
    - `packets_per_batch` (>0)
    - Constraint: `2^seq_bits % packets_per_batch == 0`

Example conversion from packed signed 4-bit payload samples to FP16:

```yaml
data_types:
  input_type: "int4"
  output_type: "fp16"
  endianness: "host"
```

After `daqiri_init()`, each GPU reorder config must be assigned a CUDA stream. CPU reorder
configs do not use CUDA streams:

```cpp
daqiri::set_reorder_cuda_stream("rx_port", "rx_reorder_0", stream);
```

For reorder queues, `timeout_us` is a fixed deadline measured from the first observed packet; later
arrivals do not extend it, and an empty batch has no timer. Hardware reorder quiesces the batch's
private RQs before dropping or exposing its output, preventing late DMA into caller-owned or
recycled storage. A cyclic hardware sender must treat timeout as final for that sequence cycle:
without an epoch field, an old late packet is indistinguishable from the same slot in a new cycle.

## Transmit Configuration (tx)

### Queues

`tx.queues:` List of transmit queues on the interface.

- **`name`**: Queue name.
  - type: `string`
- **`id`**: Integer ID used for burst submission.
  - type: `integer`
- **`poll_mode`**: `indirect` hands bursts to a DAQIRI TX worker. `direct` makes the calling
  thread submit one packet immediately and manage transmit progress; it is supported only by
  the raw ibverbs engine.
  - type: `string`
  - values: `indirect`, `direct`
  - default: `indirect`
- **`cpu_core`**: CPU core ID for the TX worker thread. Required in indirect mode and forbidden
  in direct mode. Should be an isolated core for best performance.
  - type: `string`
- **`batch_size`**: Number of packets per batch sent to the NIC. Larger values increase
  throughput, and smaller values reduce latency. Required in indirect mode and forbidden in
  direct mode; direct TX requires exactly one packet per API submission.
  - type: `integer`
- **`memory_regions`**: List of memory region names. Same segment mapping rules as RX.
  - type: `list`
- **`offloads`**: List of hardware offloads to enable. Each offload installs an RTE Flow rule
  during `daqiri_init()`; initialization fails if the NIC cannot program the rule.
  - type: `list`
  - values: `tx_eth_src` (auto-fill source MAC address)
- **`pacing_mbps`**: Packet-pacing rate cap for this queue, in megabits per second of L2 frame
  bytes (the data the application transmits, excluding preamble/IFG/FCS). The NIC meters the queue
  out so its long-run average TX rate stays at or below this value. `0` (the default) disables
  pacing and sends at line rate. DAQIRI supports packet pacing on ConnectX-7 or later. The two raw
  engines use different mechanisms: `dpdk` uses the native wait-on-time `SEND_ON_TIMESTAMP`
  offload and falls back to line rate with a warning when that offload is unavailable; `ibverbs`
  assigns the QP to an mlx5 hardware packet-pacing rate-table entry and fails initialization if
  RAW_PACKET pacing is unavailable or the requested rate is outside a range advertised by the
  device. Older drivers that omit the range defer bounds checking to the provider when the rate is
  applied. The ibverbs engine leaves the optional burst bound and typical-packet-size fields at
  their device defaults.
  - type: `integer`
  - default: `0`
- **`gpunetio.tx_kernel`**: How the `gpunetio` engine runs the CUDA kernel that posts this queue's
  packets to the NIC. `persistent` keeps one resident kernel per queue that takes bursts from a
  ring, with several bursts in flight. `per_burst` launches one kernel per `send_tx_burst()`; the
  kernel waits for the NIC to send its burst, so bursts don't overlap. Accepted only with
  `engine: "gpunetio"`.
  - type: `string`
  - values: `persistent` (default), `per_burst`

A direct TX queue creates no handoff ring or worker. One application thread owns the queue and
may have only one acquired-but-unsubmitted packet at a time. `BurstParams` remains the ownership
handle, but neither it nor the packet data crosses another CPU core: the caller writes directly
to the packet buffer and `send_tx_burst()` submits it directly. Completed packet buffers are
reclaimed on later availability, allocation, or send calls. Unsupported engines and forbidden
worker fields produce a warning followed by configuration failure.

For the raw ibverbs engine, an equivalent `TxQueueConfig` can be passed to
`add_tx_queue_async()` after initialization. The queue must reference existing memory regions and
fit the metadata capacity reserved at initialization. Runtime TX queues require no flow rule;
delete completion waits for submitted work and application-held allocations to be returned.

### GPUNetIO engine

`engine: "gpunetio"` (experimental) drives the NIC queues of a raw stream from CUDA kernels with
DOCA GPUNetIO. Each RX queue runs a resident kernel that receives into its memory region and
publishes bursts; each TX queue sends from its memory region with the kernel selected by
`gpunetio.tx_kernel`. One CPU thread per queue, on the queue's `cpu_core`, moves bursts between the
kernels and the application.

- **Receive ring:** the single memory region of an RX queue becomes the NIC receive ring and can't
  be shared with another queue. Its slots are rounded up to a power of two up to 8 kB, and its
  `num_bufs` to a power of two of at least 512 and at least `batch_size`. A received packet bigger
  than a slot stops the queue, so keep the port MTU below the slot size.
- **Ownership:** received packets stay valid until the application frees their burst with
  `free_all_packets()` (or `free_packet()` for each packet); only then does the NIC reuse their
  slots. Bursts can be freed in any order, but slots return to the NIC in arrival order, so a
  burst held for long blocks the reuse of the newer ones. When the ring is full the NIC drops
  incoming packets.
- **Bursts:** a burst holds `batch_size` packets, except at the end of the ring and when
  `timeout_us` elapses first. The packet pointers point into the region, and the lengths into
  pinned host memory.
- **Steering:** DOCA Flow matches the RX flows (IPv4/UDP or Ethernet fields) in configuration
  order, and spreads a flow with several queue IDs over them. With `flow_isolation: true`,
  unmatched packets go to the kernel, otherwise to the first RX queue.
- **Not supported:** header-data split, memory regions other than `device` and `host_pinned`,
  caller-owned memory regions, software and hardware loopback, TX offloads, `pacing_mbps`,
  `accurate_send`, `hardware_timestamps`, per-packet flow IDs (reported as `0`), dynamic and runtime
  flows, runtime resources, flex items, eCPRI matches, reorder, and direct polling.
- **CUDA:** the resident kernels run until `shutdown()`. `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` and
  `cudaFree()` of a valid pointer wait for every running kernel, so they block until then:
  synchronize streams instead, and free device memory with `cudaFreeAsync()` or after
  `shutdown()`. `cudaMalloc()`, `cudaMemcpy()` and work on other streams are not affected.

### Transmit Flows

`tx.flows:` Raw Ethernet hardware transform rules for outgoing packets. Supported on
the DPDK and ibverbs raw engines only. TX flows match the packet as supplied by the
application, then push or encapsulate headers in hardware. The application buffer remains
the pre-encap packet.

- **`name`** / **`id`**: Flow label and ID.
- **`actions`**: Ordered transform action list. TX flows cannot contain `queue`.
  - **`type: vlan_push`**: Push one VLAN tag.
    - **`vlan_id`**: VLAN ID, `0..4095`.
    - **`pcp`**: Priority, `0..7`, default `0`.
    - **`dei`**: Drop eligible indicator, `0..1`, default `0`.
    - **`ethertype`**: VLAN TPID, default `0x8100`.
  - **`type: tunnel_encap`**: Encapsulate in `vxlan`, `gre`, or `nvgre`.
    - **`tunnel.type`**: `vxlan`, `gre`, or `nvgre`.
    - **`outer_eth_src` / `outer_eth_dst`** and **`outer_ipv4_src` /
      `outer_ipv4_dst`** are required.
    - **VXLAN fields**: `vni`, optional `outer_udp_src`, `outer_udp_dst` default `4789`.
    - **GRE fields**: optional `gre_protocol` default `0x0800`.
    - **NVGRE fields**: `tni`, optional `flow_id`.
- **`match`**: Same standard UDP/IP match keys as RX flows. Omit `match` for a
  catch-all TX transform.

DAQIRI validates transform overhead against the configured packet buffer size and
the supported jumbo-frame bound. For RX decap/pop and TX encap/push, MTU sizing
accounts for the outer wire frame. Packet buffers hold the post-decap (RX) /
pre-encap (TX) frame.

### Accurate Send

`tx.accurate_send:` Enable hardware-timed packet transmission. When enabled, use
`set_packet_tx_time()` to schedule packets. The supplied timestamp is always an unsigned
64-bit PTP epoch-nanosecond value in the same clock domain as a PTP-synchronized
`CLOCK_REALTIME`. **WARNING: PTP synchronization is required.** DAQIRI does not validate the NIC or
system clock configuration. Scheduled transmission is invalid if the clocks are not
PTP-synchronized. DAQIRI requires ConnectX-7 or later for send-on-timestamp.

- type: `boolean`
- default: `false`
